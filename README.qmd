## Project Description:

This project analyzes the probability of extreme drought across Ethiopia using climate models. The analysis relies on an ensemble of climate models with a baseline reference period from 1985-2015. The focus period for this project is from 2041 to 2080. This project is meant to provide insights into Ethiopia's future climate vulnerabilities. 

### Methodology and Data
The ensemble includes 18 climate models, with two models excluded due to incomplete data. To estimate evapotranspiration, Hargreaves formulation for Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) was applied. This method uses temperature and precipitation data to offer a reliable estimate in areas where data availability is limited. Water balance calculations were as a rolling sum and performed with a 12-month integration window.

Extreme drought in the context of this project is defined as an event with a historical probability of 10% during the baseline period. This  is consistent with methodologies like the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) by Serrano et al. Unlike the traditional approach that fit statistical distributions, this project calculated deviations directly using quantiles, providing an easily interpretable measure of changing drought probabilities.
